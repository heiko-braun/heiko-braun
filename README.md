# Welcome!

I am a seasoned software development manager and former engineer who thrives at the intersection of technology, user experience and business. As an engineering manager, I have directed sizable engineering organizations, brought multiple products to market, and guided teams through the ebb and flow of high performance.

With over 20 years of experience, I combine a strong technical background that allows me to contribute to the architecture of large-scale software solutions with a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of agile and lean methodologies to devise processes and org structures that boost productivity and time to market.

I operate with empathy, a willingness to coach and an interest in working with and learning from others. I prefer a collaborative working style where people leave their egos at the door and approach others with genuine interest.

Competencies: Software development & architecture, cloud services & infrastructure, operating solutions at scale, agile & lean approaches, mentoring and development of talent, hiring and recruiting, fostering innovation and growth.
